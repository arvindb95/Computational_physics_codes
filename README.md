# Computational_physics_codes
This repo contains codes that have been written during the Spring 2019 Computaional Physics taught by Dr. Sanati at TTU. It contains a collection of codes (both python and c++) that solve specific numerical physics problems. I have used LaTeX to organize the solutions to the homeworks.
