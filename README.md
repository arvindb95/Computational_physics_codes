# Computational_physics_codes
This repo contains codes that have been written during the Spring 2019 Computaional Physics taught by Dr Sanati at TTU. It contains a collection of codes (both python and c++) that solve specific numerical physics problems. The repo pin shows that TEX is the major language used because I am using LaTeX to organize the solutions to the homeworks.
